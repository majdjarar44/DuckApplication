The Composition design pattern is a principle where objects are composed of other objects,
rather than relying solely on inheritance. Instead of creating complex hierarchies through inheritance,
you combine simpler objects to build more complex behaviors.

1 . "Has-a" relationship: Composition focuses on "has-a" relationships. For example, "a Duck has-a FlyBehavior."

Design Pricaple:

* Identify The aspects of your application that vary and Saparate them from what satys at the same
* program to an interface not an implementation 
* Favor composition over inhertance "Duck has-a FlyBehavior"
